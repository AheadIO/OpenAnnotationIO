## What are Open Annotations?

Traditional annotations are marginalia, errata, and highlights in printed books, schemas, picture, and other physical media. Open Annotations are an attempt to recreate and extend that functionality as a new layer of interactivity and linking on top of the fabric of reality. It will allow anyone to annotate anything anywhere, be it a pdf, an timeline, a video, an image, a 3d model, an audio stream, or data in raw or visualized form. Open Annotations can be linked, shared between services, tracked back to their origins, searched and discovered, and stored wherever the author wishes; the vision is for a decentralized and open annotation infrastructure.


## What are Annotations?

In OA, an Annotation is considered to be a set of connected resources. The simplest set of resources characterizing the Annotation and consists of (i) the annotation instance, a de-facto reification of the annotation, (ii) one or more targets. what we are annotating, and (iii) zero or more bodies that, if present, represent the content of the annotation or the information which is annotating the target, or targets. 

An Annotation is Resource. Typically, an Annotation has a single Body, which is a comment or other descriptive resource, and a single Target that the Body is somehow "about". The Annotation likely also has additional descriptive properties. 

Example Use Case: Pamela has written a post that makes a comment about a particular clip. Her client creates an Annotation with the post as the body resource, and the clip as the target resource.
