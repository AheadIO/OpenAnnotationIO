## What are Open Annotations?

Traditional annotations are marginalia, errata, and highlights in printed books, schemas, picture, and other physical media. Open Annotations are an attempt to recreate and extend that functionality as a new layer of interactivity and linking on top of the fabric of reality. It will allow anyone to annotate anything anywhere, be it a pdf, an timeline, a video, an image, a 3d model, an audio stream, or data in raw or visualized form. Open Annotations can be linked, shared between services, tracked back to their origins, searched and discovered, and stored wherever the author wishes; the vision is for a decentralized and open annotation infrastructure.
